#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) A single while loop is O(n), this equates to O(n^3) - O(n^2), breaks down to O(n) 


b) O(n log n). The first loop running is O(n). 
The second loop only runs when J is less than n. When it does. J increments.


c) O(n) This will run as many times as needed to get down to the basecase.
